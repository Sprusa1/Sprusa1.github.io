In the background lies forested mountains and a grand mansion in the distance."/></a></div>

                                <p class="deliciousmonsters">Delicious Monsters is a YA horror novel that follows two young black girls a decade apart: Daisy and Brittney. Daisy can see the dead, a difficult ability to have when you live in a bustling city. But when she and her mom finally move to her mother’s fabled house in Ontario, Daisy begins to count down the days to when she can start to live her life for herself. After all, her mother won’t need her to take care of her and keep them afloat much longer. But her mother has many secrets, and there is something dangerous in the house and it’s out for blood. Ten years later, Brittney and her best friend run a show called Haunted and their next season is exactly the break she needs. With the popularity and revenue, she could finally live on her own without relying on her mother while exposing the lies her mother perpetrated about the so-called Miracle Mansion that cured their abusive relationship. But few people are willing to talk and even fewer want to hear about a forgotten black girl.</p>

									<p class="deliciousmonsters">This is another book that I have very ambivalent feelings about. It weaves together cycles of trauma and abuse, complicated mother-daughter relationships, violence against black women, depression, and self-love into a story about haunted houses, possession, and a girl who can see the dead. Despite all of this tragedy, there were so many beautiful and moving moments in the story</p>
									<details class="deliciousmonsters">
									<summary class="deliciousmonsters">Spoilers</summary>
										<p class="deliciousmonsters">when Daisy pulls herself out of Ivy’s possession, choosing herself and her life and her loved ones, when Daisy begins to make her own decisions for her life including saving her mother and giving her another chance at a relationship, when Daisy chooses to stay behind with Ivy so she won’t be alone anymore, when King decides to change his vision and intervene, when Daisy realizes they have come to save her, when Brittney gets the truth of Ivy’s death from Grace and Dionne (and wasn’t that a twist), and when Daisy meets King at the memorial they made to Ivy</p>
									</details>
										<p class="deliciousmonsters">There were so many amazing parts to this book, but there were other parts that dampened the experience. In the beginning, I was more taken in by Brittney’s storyline than Daisy’s. It takes a very long time to understand what’s happening on Daisy’s end, even though she is the true main character of the story, while Brittney’s was more of a frame to look at Daisy’s life from another perspective. Given the happy endings that everyone experiences, I was hoping that Brittney’s would be more tied-up, especially in terms of her mother. While part of her has clearly healed after her experiences in the investigation, the success of their show and her financial dependence on her mother are left up in the air. Given the twist Sambury is hiding,</p>
									<details class="deliciousmonsters">
									<summary class="deliciousmonsters">Spoilers</summary>
										<p>that it’s Ivy and not Daisy’s death which they’re investigating, </p> 
									</details>
										<p class="deliciousmonsters">it makes sense why Brittney’s parts are much shorter and sparser. However, to me it seemed like her whole story was building up to something, only for it to have been a plot device. I also had so much trouble working my way through the middle portion of the book. Again, this book has a good beginning and ending but the rest felt very inconsequential to the plot. There’s a lot of investigating, running around the house, and trying to discover Grace’s secrets, but it takes so long to get there that a majority of the book felt like a chore to read. I think another part is that I was hoping for more action and thriller, which we don’t get until later. It was disheartening because there were so many great parts at the end of the book and I know a lot of people absolutely loved it. </p>
