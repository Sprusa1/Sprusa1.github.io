                                <h2>Review</h2>
                                    <p>So this was one of my favorite books in high school, but I never 
                                    actually finished the series so I decided to re-read and get caught up on 
                                    this whole universe. I adored this book when I first read it. I still liked 
                                    it this time, but I found more to be annoyed with this time. Caraval as a 
                                    setting is atmospheric and magical. I’d love to be one of those less 
                                    serious participants and pop in for an adventure or just to sight see. I 
                                    also liked the tied color-emotion descriptions that Scarlett’s narration is 
                                    known for. I found Scarlett vaguely annoying at the beginning of the game 
                                    but I think part of it was knowing that a lot of her worries end up not 
                                    mattering. Plus the amount of characters in the book who berate her, 
                                    question her decisions, and call her naive or too trusting did not help my  
                                    opinion of her. 
                                    <details>
                                    <summary>Spoilers</summary>
                                    Given basically everyone and everything turned out to be a lie, 
                                    </details> Scarlett deserved a lot better.</p>


                                    <p>Speaking of that point, the twists were good, but overdone near the 
                                    end. There’s only so many times Julian can lie to Scarlett and get a 
                                    new backstory before it gets old. 
                                    <details><summary>Spoilers</summary> 
                                    He starts out as some sailor Tella uses to get off the island to Caraval, but he’s played before and sticks around to help Scarlett. Then she believes he’s Legend and involved with Rosa’s death. But wait he’s actually Rosa’s heartbroken brother working to get revenge on Legend. Except that’s also not true because he’s one of Legend’s players tasked with bringing her to Caraval and was everything they had a lie? Turns out he does like her and wants to try (now that he’s no longer dead) but by the way he’s Legend’s brother.</details> It’s too much.</p>
                                             
                                    <p>The ending plot twist with Tella was convoluted and I don't think the characters truly ackknowledge how messed up it was.
                                    
                                    <details>
                                    <summary>Spoilers</summary>
                                    Tella’s whole plot with Legend at the end made for higher stakes and 
                                    drama but I don’t get how Scarlett isn’t more upset. That was 
                                    incredibly depressing and traumatizing for her only to find out half of 
                                    it was fake and the rest wasn’t permanent. I’m glad Tella wasn’t 
                                    actually that naive or condescending and that she and Julian are okay 
                                    but it was still convoluted and messed up.</details></p>
                                           
                                    <p>Julian is on thin ice and I’d like to see some more development with 
                                    Scarlett beyond attraction.</p>
                                            
                                     <p>Scarlett’s exploration of Caraval was very entertaining, but the 
                                    clues/scavenger hunt didn’t make a lot of sense. It all felt very 
                                    arbitrary and hardly like she was progressing in any way.</p>
                                                            
                                    <p>Despite all that, I still enjoyed the book and had a fun time 
                                    reading it. I’m looking forward to re-reading the next one.</p>
