                                <h2 class="sadie">Review</h2>
                                    <p class="sadie">I’m not quite sure how to begin with this book. It’s powerful and heavy and so vastly different from what I thought it was going to be. And I know this is going to sit with me for a long time.</p>

                                    <p class="sadie">This book is described like a mystery, but it’s really not about that at all. At least not in the way I think of traditional mysteries. The narrative is told from the perspective of Sadie, searching for her little sister Mattie’s killer, and from Wes McCray, a podcast journalist who has picked up Sadie’s story after she has gone missing. The general whodunit and why that I was expecting isn’t really a part of it. Sadie knows what happened (even if it takes a while for her to explain that to us) and Wes’ investigation is largely parallel and two steps behind Sadie’s journey. Rather, the focus is on the sisters’ relationship: how much Sadie loves Mattie as well as the things she is willing to do for that love because no one else will.</p>

                                    <p class="sadie">I was not prepared for the monster Keith/Darren/Jack was. (Seriously check the content warnings. I was caught off guard and even more unsettled because of it). So much of Sadie’s journey involves the effects and reactions to his abuse, which is never fully described on the page. Instead we get disturbing flashback scenes of creepy behavior, the emotional turmoil of the evidence he and Silas kept, as well as testimonies from a host of characters who thought they were great guys. All of that makes this so much more real because “girls go missing all the time” but rarely are we forced into the true aftermath of these stories.</p>
                                    
                                    <details class="sadie">
                                        <summary class="sadie">Spoilers for the Ending</summary>
                                            <p>There was no other way to end this book. Apparently the ending is contentious, and I get that because usually such an open-ending feels unfinished and unsatisfying, but it would have hurt the story to do things differently.</p>
                                    </details>

									<p class="sadie">A quick note on the audio production: This is one of the best audiobooks that I have listened to! There are multiple narrators for the alternating POV chapters, and a lot of Wes' chapters start out like a true crime podcast. If you are at all interested in audiobooks, this one is a great example!</p>
